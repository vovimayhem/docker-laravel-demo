# This file is an override to the default 'docker-compose.yml' file, and is
# intended to be used in CI contexts (drone, github actions, semaphore, etc).
#
# The most important thing it does is re-uses the services defined in the main
# file (docker-compose.yml) such as postgres, pubsub, etc.
#
# To make it work, be sure you use an alias for docker-compose called
# `staging-compose`. You can create one like this:
# `alias staging-compose="docker-compose --file docker-compose.yml --file staging-compose.yml"`
